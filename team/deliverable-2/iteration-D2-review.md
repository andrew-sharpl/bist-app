## Process - Reflection

### Q1. What worked well

1. Our sub-teams are split up well. Within each of our sub-teams, we are feeling productive and supported. Each sub-team was able to work independently while progressing development of the entire project.
2. Meeting schedule has worked well for the team. Most, if not all members attend the regular meetings. Those who cannot always communicate the fact beforehand and make accommodations.
3. Our partner selection was a good one! Our partner is very engaged with the project while maintaining realistic expectations of us, which has been amazing. We have been enjoying the opportunity to learn more about the UX/UI research relating to individuals with brain injuries and making decisions based on that, to better cater app to our target users.

### Q2. What did not work well

1. We decided at our first partner meeting that we wanted to have weekly check ins with BIST. This have proved to be too frequent- we’re often coming to our meeting with not much to show and it can feel like we’re wasting our partner’s time.
2. We’ve done a poor job breaking down our user stories into development tickets for our team. This has left members of our team feeling like they don’t know what to work on and that they may not be contributing enough.
3. We haven’t been making great use of our Kanban boards- oftentimes we’ll just work on what we know has to get done (communicating on Discord when needed), not moving any tickets until the end of a sprint. We’ve been able to get away with this because of the small size of our sub-teams, but in a larger team, we would probably find ourselves stepping on our teammates toes. This is probably caused at least in part by the previous point.

### Q3(a). Planned changes

1. Spend more time creating development tickets and checking in with the Kanban boards. This should help our team feel more organized and productive.
2. Create a plan for our meetings. Having a specific goal in mind when we meet will ensure that we make progress during the session and avoid wasting any time from not having questions to ask. We will also select a team member to guide and facilitate the meetings.

### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps

The DevOps automations were merged with the backend components first and this was fairly straight forward since we had discussed what the testing/starting commands would be. The integration of the frontend with the backend also went smoothly since the sub-teams had communicated what the API would be before A2. All the frontend team had to do was sub out their mock API responses for real API responses and they were good to go!

## Product - Review

Our demo was just the A2 progress from our frontend team. We had not yet connected up to the real backend. We screen shared one of our developers’ phone screens and walked BIST through the feature we had implemented.

We were able to demo three large pieces of our frontend: the login screen, a basic implementation of the appointments menu (creating and listing user appointments), and our events system where users could enroll in events from a list, view enrolled events, and cancel enrollment.

Our partner was very happy with what we had implemented. The one change they requested was that we have real BIST events listed instead of placeholders, but we reassured them that this was coming soon!

Our main learning is that our partner is not very technical, so they’re pretty lenient and flexible with what we’re delivering. It seems like they would be happy with just about anything we’re able to make for them, which is simultaneously good and bad for us! We need to make sure we’re being honest with ourselves and our partner in what we’re delivering.
